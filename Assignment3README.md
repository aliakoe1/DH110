# Assignment 3- Contextual Inquiry 

### Alia Koe - DH110 

## Research goal, Constraints, and Target User 



## Research Methods and Plan 

Research Methods: I plan to use overt observation and do a mixture of active and passive interaction. I plan to be passive observation  by employing 
a section of free discussion time and then active during a question and answer portion. 

Plan: My current plan is to have dinner at Emily(one of my roommate’s) grandparents’ house in Bel Air. 
I scheduled it to be Friday Night at 6pm. I decided that an in person context is better because her grandparents are more old fashioned 
and enjoy face to face interaction. The activities I want to observe is how they talk to each other, what they talk about, and what they
highlight when they reconnect. I decided that the best way to interact with the users is to let them talk on their own and catch up for 
30 minutes and observe on the side and then ask the group questions for at least an hour. I hope to voice memo and take a video
of the session.

## Reflection 

Overall, this was a very fun process to be a part of. My goal for this assignment was to observe how a family talks to each other and how they connect. 
This dinner allowed me to gain valuable insight about the problem space. I was able to learn about what kinds of topics they connect on and the type of 
experiences they hope to gain out of communicating with their family members over technology. I was able to gather information about how they enjoyed connecting
with one another and what areas they would hope to hear more about. I was also able to learn about their preferred mode of communication which led to insight 
on how a platform could translate those desires and requests into design implementations.
