# Assignment 7: Interactive Prototype
### DH 110 -Alia Koe 

## Brief Description 
This prototype aims to flesh out the product idea. It allows potential investors to be able to see a version of the product communicated in a way that is easy to visualize its structure and execution. It also allows designers to see potential changes that need to occur and think of the product from a different perspective. My project helps families be a deeper part of each others' lives through  direct photo stream sharing. 

## Tasks 
- The user is able to view the posts of the group through the navigation of the home page. They can play with various layout features like the filter by grid or filter by group. 
- The user can envision what happens when they open a group feed with no posts. 
- The user also can see the different groups that they are a part of and see its details. 
- They also have the ability to leave a group that they are a part of. 
- They can see the progression of opening the camera, taking a picture, and uploading it. 
- They can also see settings and profile view.

### Task Design Flows
This displays the navigation of the home page which is where the user spends majority of their time. They are able to see different content and navigate the filter of different groups. In addition the prototype shows them the difference between the regular view and the grid view. It also shows what a group feed looks like when there are no active posts.
