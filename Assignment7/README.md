# Assignment 7: Interactive Prototype
### DH 110 -Alia Koe 

## Brief Description 
This prototype aims to flesh out the product idea. It allows potential investors to be able to see a version of the product communicated in a way that is easy to visualize its structure and execution. It also allows designers to see potential changes that need to occur and think of the product from a different perspective. My project helps families be a deeper part of each others' lives through  direct photo stream sharing. 

## Tasks 
- The user is able to view the posts of the group through the navigation of the home page. They can play with various layout features like the filter by grid or filter by group. 
- The user can envision what happens when they open a group feed with no posts. 
- The user also can see the different groups that they are a part of and see its details. 
- They also have the ability to leave a group that they are a part of. 
- They can see the progression of opening the camera, taking a picture, and uploading it. 
- They can also see settings and profile view.

### Task Design Flows

#### Task 1- Home Navigation/ Interacting with Content 
This displays the navigation of the home page which is where the user spends majority of their time. They are able to see different content and navigate the filter of different groups. In addition the prototype shows them the difference between the regular view and the grid view. It also shows what a group feed looks like when there are no active posts. See the animation to get a thorough walk through this flow!!

#### Task 2 - Group Navigation
This shows the navigation of the groups. It starts with the group page that allows you to see which groups you are a part of. Then you can see what creating a new group looks like. This flow then shows you how to see the group details and leave a group and what it looks like when you leave a group. It also shows you what its like to take a picture and upload it to the feed. Then it shows the profile tab and the settings tab.

## Cognitive Walkthrough 
I conducted cognitive walkthroughs on two of my roommates, Maddie and Chloe. I got very useful feedback. Something that I found that is helpful is I saw gaps in some of my designs. I now will incorporate a chat and like feature in my future iterations of design.

## Usability Tests 

I conducted 7 usability tests on my roommates and my close friends. I allowed them to navigate through the current prototype to see potential areas where the user may have trouble. I also got their feedback on the various features and possible features to implement. 

here are the themes that I found: 
- users would want additional ways to interact with content (likes and comments) 
- there should be an ability to delete posts 


## Increased interactions

I decided to implement a comment function and a like ability. The comments allow the user to see the profile picture of the other users that commented on the post. They 

## Delete Post 
![deleting a post](https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110/blob/main/Assignment7/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20at%209.59.37%20PM.png) 
I added an edit button to the profile page that allows the user to delete their post from their profile page.To account for older users I included a large trash can icon on the images to make it easy to indicate that the image is deletable and clickable. In addition, the menu asks them to confirm their selection to ensure that the user wants to delete their post.
