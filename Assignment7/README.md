# Assignment 7: Interactive Prototype
### DH 110 -Alia Koe 

## Brief Description 
This prototype aims to flesh out the product idea. It allows potential investors to be able to see a version of the product communicated in a way that is easy to visualize its structure and execution. It also allows designers to see potential changes that need to occur and think of the product from a different perspective. My project helps families be a deeper part of each others' lives through  direct photo stream sharing. 

## Tasks
