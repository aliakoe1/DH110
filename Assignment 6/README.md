# Assignment 6: Interface Design 
## DH 110 - Alia Koe 

## Introduction 
 My project is a photo compiling application that allows different members of a group to upload and share moments from their lives and keep each other updated. The intended audience is families that are separated by distance and aims to deepen connections and create a foundation of conversation topics to be able to update each other with. The purpose of the interface design is to optimize the user experience through a usable and accessible design. This allows me to clarify the design and receive casual and professional feedback to create the best product possible.
