# Assignment 6: Interface Design 
## DH 110 - Alia Koe 

## Introduction 
 My project is a photo compiling application that allows different members of a group to upload and share moments from their lives and keep each other updated. The intended audience is families that are separated by distance and aims to deepen connections and create a foundation of conversation topics to be able to update each other with. The purpose of the interface design is to optimize the user experience through a usable and accessible design. This allows me to clarify the design and receive casual and professional feedback to create the best product possible.

This was a very interesting conversation and a helpful exercise. It definitely made me reflect on certain design decisions and understand which ones to defend and which ones I also agreed with. Specifically, I do agree that I should maintain one font type throughout the webpage. I also did not realize that a possible grouping of the post information would be helpful or intentionally create space to make the content be the main focus of the page is important. I am happy that she enjoyed the tab bar because it took a while to figure out. I agree with the point about how the tab bar could look less colored but I might remove the labels for readability. 
## Accessibility Tests
### Check for Light Mode

### Additional Check

This accessibility has an additional check. I found that the biggest issues were that when the text size is increased to account for eyesight difficulties, the buttons turn to be a bit hard to read and the page does not maintain its appeal. I think one way to possibly remedy this issue is to increase the space between buttons to account for a possible larger text size.
