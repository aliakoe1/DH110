# Assignment 6: Interface Design 
## DH 110 - Alia Koe 

## Introduction 
 My project is a photo compiling application that allows different members of a group to upload and share moments from their lives and keep each other updated. The intended audience is families that are separated by distance and aims to deepen connections and create a foundation of conversation topics to be able to update each other with. The purpose of the interface design is to optimize the user experience through a usable and accessible design. This allows me to clarify the design and receive casual and professional feedback to create the best product possible.

This was a very interesting conversation and a helpful exercise. It definitely made me reflect on certain design decisions and understand which ones to defend and which ones I also agreed with. Specifically, I do agree that I should maintain one font type throughout the webpage. I also did not realize that a possible grouping of the post information would be helpful or intentionally create space to make the content be the main focus of the page is important. I am happy that she enjoyed the tab bar because it took a while to figure out. I agree with the point about how the tab bar could look less colored but I might remove the labels for readability. 
## Accessibility Tests
### Check for Light Mode

### Check for Dark Mode

### Additional Check

This accessibility has an additional check. I found that the biggest issues were that when the text size is increased to account for eyesight difficulties, the buttons turn to be a bit hard to read and the page does not maintain its appeal. I think one way to possibly remedy this issue is to increase the space between buttons to account for a possible larger text size.

## Discussion 
For typography, I decided to use "Inter". I compared many different fonts and originally thought that the font would be similar to that used by the Uber interface. However, I wanted to create a very clean interface and wanted accessibility to be the main focus instead of visual appeal. I also wanted to use a very simple font. 

In terms of color, I wanted the middle button to stand out. The gradient really highlights the button and makes it easy to see. I originally had the tab bar and filter button to be black but through the impresssion test, I found that it was a bit too dark and needed to have less harsh of a contrast. 

I tried to create a very simple layout with minimal information. I had to adjust to ensure that the filter button fit below the iphone microphone so that it would display correctly. In addition, I grouped the grid and the filter button together because it allows the user to understand that if they want to change the layout they can navigate to this grouping of buttons. In addition, I included the profile and settings on the bottom to be grouped because they typically do not have to be accessed in the tasks of uploading and accessing content.
