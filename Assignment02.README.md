 DH 110 - Alia Koe

## Purpose of UT

I plan on testing Locket, a competitive app to my idea on photo sharing streams. I am interested to see how users specifically add content 
through the app and if they enjoy the current route to add and upload photos.  Especially based on my findings of my heuristic evaluation, 
I am interested in seeing whether or not the navigation between different functions of the app is easy for the user despite its poor design.

## Reflection 

I learned that conducting a usability test is more difficult than it looks. I think I went into the process thinking that it was simple 
but it actually takes a large amount of focus, precision, and intention to create clear and precise questions. I also had to adjust to 
the fact that it is an app and not a website to conduct the zoom on my phone. Conducting the zoom trying to screen record but also record the
user was very difficult. I would want to create more general tasks to see how the user navigated the app in general. I think this would give 
me insight on overall app navigation which I am interested in. I would also see if there is a way to screen record and conduct a zoom on a computer
and then edit the video to be on a split screen so it would be a clear video for both.
