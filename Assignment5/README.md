# Assignment 5 - Low Fidelity Prototype 

## Description of Project 

  My project idea is a photo stream app for families. This platform will enable users to share small moments in their day through picture or video and easily access content by their family. Users can filter content per contributor to stay abreast to what is happening in their loved ones lives. This app is structured to simply create and receive content through a very straightforward, linear process which other platforms tend to complicate. The goal is to strengthen the bond between families by allowing them to communicate in a way that is accessible for multiple generations. 

## Purpose of Prototype 

  The purpose of this exercise is to flesh out my ideas for this platform in a visual manner. It is important to understand that this is the first iteration of many for this project. The low fidelity prototype allows the designer to think through the flow and different functions of the app and revise if neccessary. It also allows the user to retain feedback from the current ideas before moving forward and developing the ideas. 
  
## Prototype
### Tasks 
  For this prototype, I plan to focus on the flow of 
  1) creating content 
  2) accessing content. 

With creating content, there is going to be a camera function within the app, it will have very limited features often associated with a camera and will just enable photo and video. So, first, users will be able to either take a picture or a video, then they will be able to select to upload it or exit the camera function 

With accessing content, the user will automatically be able to see a stream of content from their group. They will have the ability to access other groups in this frame, as well as filter the content into a grid or stream scrolling view. They will also have the ability to like and comment on content and there may be a feature that allows them to record a voice reaction to the content.

## Reflection/Feedback 

Overall, the low fidelity prototype was a lot more rough than I anticipated. I was able to receive lots of feedback from the user testing of the flow which calls for many iterations and edits to the prototype. It was also interesting to see how the user liked and disliked certain features and believed that some actions were too complex for the purpose of the app. With the goal of simplicity, it was helpful to ask the user their opinion on if it upholds this value or not.
