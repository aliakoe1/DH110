# Assignment 4 : User Personas and Scenario 

## Purpose of UX Storytelling 
The Purpose of UX storytelling in any project is to input yourself as the designer into the perspective of the user. 
This is important because it furthers a position of empathy to bring insight into the problem space and enables the designer 
to create a more well-rounded product. It highlights behaviors in the user and materializes issues that
can come up with the model. It also allows the creator to move with direction and precision when designing a prototype.
