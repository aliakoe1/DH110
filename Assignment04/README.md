# Assignment 4 : User Personas and Scenario 

## Purpose of UX Storytelling 
The Purpose of UX storytelling in any project is to input yourself as the designer into the perspective of the user. 
This is important because it furthers a position of empathy to bring insight into the problem space and enables the designer 
to create a more well-rounded product. It highlights behaviors in the user and materializes issues that
can come up with the model. It also allows the creator to move with direction and precision when designing a prototype. 

In my project, this storytelling will help me understand users from different generations. My project focuses on allowing families across two generations (grandparents to adults to kids) to share photos throughout their day to encourage connection and conversation. This exercise will help me put myself in the shoes of someone at different intensity or levels of technological literacy. Because my project has 3 ideal users, it is important to contemplate the different stresses and problems that could occur across these different audiences as well as subgroup specific issues. 

## Tasks 

1) One task would be to simply upload a moment that they want to share in their life. They would come up with some content to share and simply take a picture in the app and then upload it to the stream. 

2) Another task would be to access content that a certain person recently posted. This would require the user to open the app, navigate to a section where they can see their groups, and then open their group, and then navigate to the filter, and select the filter by one person.

## Scenarios & Journey Map 

### Why Anne is using this product 

Anne spends most of her time at home and is a lonely elderly person. She enjoys playing online chess and tending to her garden. Her family is one of her main sources of comfort, entertainment, and love being a widow with many of her friends having passed away. She misses them dearly and wants to visit them but can no longer drive due to old age. She has trouble sending texts and it often takes her hours figuring out how to send a simple message. She also occasionally emails her family but sometimes runs into technical issues. This product allows her to easily engage with her family in a simple way. She is able to scroll through a stream of recent moments of their lives. It allows her to feel more connected to her loved ones as well as easily share small moments from her day. 

### How Anne is using this product 

When she woke up, she was hungry and excited for the sunny day. She goes out to her garden and sees all of the lovely fruit that is in bloom because of the spring season. She decided to make pancakes with the new blueberries from the bush in her garden. Anne makes the perfectly round pancake and is so excited and wants to share this lovely morning with her family. She decides to open the product and snap a picture of her pancakes so her family can see it. She is happy when she sees her daughter send a selfie responding to her pancake photo in the stream. Later in the day, she realizes that she has not heard from her granddaughter recently. Anne is sad and wishes that she could visit her granddaughter but she cannot drive an hour to go see her. They have dinner plans a month from now but it is too far away to remember to tell her about her lovely pancakes. She is also curious about what is happening in her granddaughter’s life. So she opens the app and looks at the stream and sees all of the things the rest of her family is up to. She specifically wants to see what her granddaughter has been doing at college so she filters the stream to just show posts from her granddaughter. As she navigates to the stream, she is overjoyed when looking at the lovely pictures of her and her friends, new books she is reading, and all of the fun college things she does from day to day.

### Why Carrie is using this product 

Carrie's days are filled with friends, exercise, good food, nature and house upkeep. Every week, she goes to a book club with her closest pals and get brunch at different spots in the local area. She is so excited about all of the new food that she finds so she wants to share it with her family. She also wants to share it with her closest friends from high school. She typically makes posts on Instagram but they always take a long time to post and she is never sure that her closest friends and family see her posts. This is because their viewing depends on whether or not they use the app in the time frame that her post is active. She would also post on Facebook but she has many friends from high school on this platform and doesn’t necessarily want to share such detailed content to these more peripheral friends. She dislikes posting on Facebook because some friends from high school interact with her content. She also hates the ads that pop up after she posts about a certain product or thing that she is interested in (i.e posting about baking and getting ads for new cookware). She uses this product because it specifically enables her to share content directly to a group of people. This way she doesn’t have to individually text them updates about her life. This app allows her to privately share these fun moments with her family. 

### How Carrie is using this product 

Carrie is home alone late on a Thursday night because her husband has gone to play basketball with his buddies in his pickup league. She has completed all of the things that she needs to get done but is not tired enough to fall asleep. Carrie watches a lot of television shows and movies but is currently uninterested in the ones that are popular right now. As a recent empty nester, she has been having a hard time not feeling lonely while her kids are away at school. She tried to call one of her daughters every other day but never wants to disturb her during class time and make her daughter think something urgent has happened. Her daughter does not have anything happening in her life at the moment where she needs unsolicited advice or help with a certain issue so Carrie doesn’t even know what to say when she bothers her. She is very curious about what her daughter’s life is like in college but her daughter never posts on the typical social media -Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. Carrie opens the app to see if her daughter has posted anything recently to the stream. She is excited when she sees all of the things her daughter has been doing when she filters the stream to be a grid view and then filters it by only her daughter’s additions to the stream. Carrie is so excited when being able to scroll through this stream of selfies her daughter has took and is able to feel less lonely.. It gives her a sense of peace, comfort, and joy being able to see into the lives that her kids are building. She also uses it to see what her parents have been up to as well to show them what she has been up to.

### Why Rachel is using this product 

Rachel is a college student and is constantly on her phone, swiping on dating apps, updating her friends about what she is doing once a day through Bereal, crafting fun photo dumps on Instagram and selling some of her clothes on Depop and Facebook Marketplace. When she is not in class, she is listening to music and posting on Snapchat or sending fun videos to her friends or roommates. In these busy days, she wants to send photos to her mom but if her mom gets a text notification while she is sleeping she might freak out and think something is happened. This has lead Rachel to only text her during the hours of 9am to 5pm. With this app, she is able to privately share moments of the day with her family without having to show her friends and worry about her digital identity. She is able to post a cute dog she saw on Janss that day or a really good Starbucks drink that she is enjoying lately. This product creates a simple stream of content that she can privately share moments of her day with her family without having to post on her social media. It enables her to post the fun parts of her day like a fun meal or even a cool penny she found on the ground. It also allows her to see what is happening in her parents and grandparents lives in an intimate way. 
 

### How Rachel is using this product 

Rachel woke up this morning early for her 8am class. Usually she wears sweats to class because it is so early but today she decided to put effort into her outfit. She is so excited to show her mom because her mom shares her love of fashion. She opens the app and quickly snaps a pic and posts it to the stream. However, it is too early in the morning to text her mother without her freaking out. Her dad sees it and notices that she stole his favorite leather jacket.  Later in the day she decides to do some homework for her social psychology class and goes to the local coffee shop, Ministry of Coffee. She usually only gets an iced vanilla latte but decides today to try a baked good. She is debating whether or not to get pumpkin bread or a blueberry muffin. She decides to get a blueberry muffin because it reminds her of her grandmother's amazing blueberry chocolate chip muffins. She wants to show her grandmother but also her mom who loves those muffins. Instead of creating a group chat for a seemingly insignificant thing, she posts it to the stream! Her grandmother sees it and calls her later in the day. Rachel is very excited but is unsure about what to ask her grandmother about in terms of happenings in her life. She quickly opens the app and filters post by what her grandmother has been up to. She sees that she recently joined a walking club so she asks her about that!
