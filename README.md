# DH110-ALIAKOE

## Details 
My role in this project was UX Design and Research as I created this app for my DH 110 class. I primarily used Figma for this project. I completed this project over 10 weeks. 

## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a resource that allows families to have direct communication with each other through a social platform structure. 

## Background 
For this project, we were told to create an app that helps families. There was a wide range of options and directions that I could have taken. However, I was inspired by the way that my roommate Lucy's family stays connected through their snapchat group chat. I wanted to create a platform that could extend the accessibility scope to grandparents and make the main focus of the app to share moments with their family. 

## Research 
### Competitive Analysis 
I started my research process by looking at competitive apps that do something similar to the goal of this app. I focused on apps that focused on generating an easy to acess stream of content. Often these apps included a widget function but I chose not to include that in this app because that was not the focus of this app.

The first app that I analyzed was Locket and I found that they did a good job of creating different sections of the app like a camera function, content navigation, and group navigation. However, there was no centralized navigation bar which made it a bit difficult to navigate. Users enjoyed scrolling through the content in a easy to use stream.

The second app that I analyzed was called Ekko which focuses on creating a stream of content accesible through a widget. I found that directing the user to the tab that they will use the most often helps the user find the platform easier to navigate.
