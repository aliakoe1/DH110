# Stream -ALIAKOE

## Details 
My role in this project was UX Design and Research as I created this app for my DH 110 class. I primarily used Figma for this project. I completed this project over 10 weeks. 


## Introduction
For this project, we were told to create an app that helps families. There was a wide range of options and directions that I could have taken. However, I was inspired by the way that my roommate Lucy's family stays connected through their snapchat group chat. I wanted to create a platform that could extend the accessibility scope to grandparents and make the main focus of the app to share moments with their family. 

## Design Statement 
<b> The goal of this project was to create a resource that allows families to have direct communication with each other through a social platform structure. </b> 

## Competitor Analysis 
I started my research process by looking at competitive apps that do something similar to the goal of this app. I focused on apps that focused on generating an easy to acess stream of content. Often these apps included a widget function but I chose not to include that in this app because that was not the focus of this app. <br>

 <br>
The first app that I analyzed was Locket and I found that they did a good job of creating different sections of the app like a camera function, content navigation, and group navigation. However, there was no centralized navigation bar which made it a bit difficult to navigate. Users enjoyed scrolling through the content in a easy to use stream. I also conducted a usability test with this app to see the strengths and weakenesses of its design. <br>

<br>
The second app that I analyzed was called Ekko which focuses on creating a stream of content accesible through a widget. I found that directing the user to the tab that they will use the most often helps the user find the platform easier to navigate. <br>

## User Research 
I then conducted research on the target users to better understand how to tailor the platform to different generations. I used a mixture of active and passive interaction, first studying the conversation topics that naturally came up and then asked them questions about how they interact with their family members currently. I organized a dinner with some of my roommates and my friend Emily's grandparents. We went over to dinner and I was able to understand that users <b> wish to share small moments to keep each other updated to faciliate in person interaction</b>. <br>

## UX Storytelling 
I then generated user personas based on my research to create a clear image of the users. I focused on the different age ranges of the families and generated three different personas: a teen in college, a mother at home, and a grandmother. Creating multiple personas enabled me to gain understanding on multiple perspectives for this platform.

<br>
I also created journey maps from this research and created specific scenarios to <b> better visualize and understand</b> the user at different points of interaction with this app. <br>

I learned that the app had to be <b> easy to use and accessible for older users</b>.

## Low Fidelity Prototype
#### Initial Sketches 

Then, I used this research to work with precision and design the first iteration of this app. I knew that this would be a very rough draft and that it would be a very bare and minimal version of the prototype with lots of changes needed. I learned that <b> my final prototype would look drastically different </b>. I focused on desgining the two most important tasks for this app which was creating and accessing content. <br> 
<img width="482" alt="lofi1" src="https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110/assets/114698982/8c03d11c-a158-40e1-a681-a872dfe6a0d1"><img width="384" alt="lofif" src="https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110/assets/114698982/1d1a0668-0783-454a-97a7-50bf6ab1861d">

 <br>

I then received feedback from my roommate Raine, on this very low fidelity version and learned that there would be five tabs: <b> home/feed, a tab to see groups, taking a picture, profile, and settings. </b>

#### Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation 

After better understanding the overall layout of the app, I began to design and visualize different iterations of the app. I played with different buttons, icons, and typography. <b> I was able to refine the aesthetic for this app. </b> <br> 

<img width="426" alt="typevar" src="https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110/assets/114698982/ec5b45b8-ec6b-4b6f-aeb0-4a764f1b5f41">

<img width="547" alt="buttonvar" src="https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110/assets/114698982/434ffb8d-3a76-44a7-ae73-01895824e590">

<br>

I focused on the home screen and created different versions of its layout and functions. As you can tell, there were a lot of aspects to figure out. Specifically, I was originally going to have a favorites tab where the user could save content to discuss with their loved one in person, however I learned that this would be a natural part of conversation as I revisted my contextual inquiry exercise. <br>

<img width="934" alt="screen iterations" src="https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110/assets/114698982/2302c847-41a8-4b11-be22-68d48474d2af">

<br>

After finalizing those decisions and making some edits, I created a design system and finished the low fidelity prototype. <br>

## High Fidelity Prototype
After many iterations and lots of contemplation, I created a high fidelity prototype. As I focused on specific tasks that the user would engage in, it helped me gain a clearer understanding of the orientation of the app and highlighted areas of weakeness. 

I created an overall wireflow to help visualize the different places the user could go to navigate through the app.

## Revision 
#### Cognitive Walkthrough 
I then asked various roommates, classmates, and friends for feedback as I walked them through the app. Through this process, I was able to see two frustrations of the user and that pertained to the <b> Nielsen Heuristic 3 user control and freedom</b>. I realized that I needed to give the user the ability to delete posts that they might have added by mistake or no longer align with. In addition, I had to increase the flexibility of the app and allow for a higher rate of interaction between users. Therefore, I added the ability to delete a post as well as add a like and comment. <br>

<br> 

I was also able to get feedback from other designers in a cognitive walkthrough. <br>

#### Accessibility 
After making certain decisions, I checked the accessibility of the app. <b> Especially for older users, making sure that all of these decisions optimize accesibility is essential to the success of this app. </b>

## Conclusion

Over this process, I learned about how to properly research, design, and create a product. In this specific project, I learned that it is important to focus on the simplicity of the product and making sure it properly accomplishes its goals. In addition, I learned the value of multiple rounds of feedback and iteration of design. I am very proud of the product that I created and I hope that you enjoy navigating it as well. <br>
Here are three of my takeaways: <br>
- <b>Interact with users and get real feedback!</b> It is important to empathize with the user and visualize different points of interaction with the app that may be difficult or hard to achieve. However, real feedback and asking different people in your life (friends, families, strangers, classmates, and experts) can give you a fresh perspective to your project. <br>
- <b>Experimenting is important!</b> Your designs will be more refined when you try out different variations for various elements. Also switching the layout of multiple screens can help you get a better understanding for your vision for the platform. <br>
- <b>Check heuristics along the way!</b> I verified that my original design for the app considered the different heuristics of design. However, with multiple rounds of iteration of the design some of these checks got lost. It is important to verify that the new designs also align with these important standards.
