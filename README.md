# DH110-ALIAKOE

## Details 
My role in this project was UX Design and Research as I created this app for my DH 110 class. I primarily used Figma for this project. I completed this project over 10 weeks. 

## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a resource that allows families to have direct communication with each other through a social platform structure. 

## Background 
For this project, we were told to create an app that helps families. There was a wide range of options and directions that I could have taken. However, I was inspired by the way that my roommate Lucy's family stays connected through their snapchat group chat. I wanted to create a platform that could extend the accessibility scope to grandparents and make the main focus of the app to share moments with their family. 

## Research 
### Competitive Analysis 
I started my research process by looking at competitive apps that do something similar to the goal of this app. I focused on apps that focused on generating an easy to acess stream of content. Often these apps included a widget function but I chose not to include that in this app because that was not the focus of this app.

The first app that I analyzed was Locket and I found that they did a good job of creating different sections of the app like a camera function, content navigation, and group navigation. However, there was no centralized navigation bar which made it a bit difficult to navigate. Users enjoyed scrolling through the content in a easy to use stream. I also conducted a usability test with this app to see the strengths and weakenesses of its design.

The second app that I analyzed was called Ekko which focuses on creating a stream of content accesible through a widget. I found that directing the user to the tab that they will use the most often helps the user find the platform easier to navigate.

## Contextual Inquiry 
I then conducted research on the target users to better understand how to tailor the platform to different generations. I used a mixture of active and passive interaction, first studying the conversation topics that naturally came up and then asked them questions about how they interact with their family members currently. I organized a dinner with some of my roommates and my friend Emily's grandparents. We went over to dinner and I was able to understand that users <b> wish to share small moments to keep each other updated to faciliate in person interaction</b>. <br>

## UX Storytelling 
I then generated user personas based on my research to create a clear image of the users. I focused on the different age ranges of the families and generated three different personas: a teen in college, a mother at home, and a grandmother. Creating multiple personas enabled me to gain understanding on multiple perspectives for this platform.

<br>
I also created journey maps from this research and created specific scenarios to <b> better visualize and understand</b> the user at different points of interaction with this app. <br>

I learned that the app had to be <b> easy to use and accessible for older users</b>.

## Low Fidelity Prototype

Then, I used this research to work with precision and design the first iteration of this app. I knew that this would be a very rough draft and that it would be a very bare and minimal version of the prototype with lots of changes needed. I learned that <b> my final prototype would look drastically different </b>. I focused on desgining the two most important tasks for this app which was creating and accessing content. <br>

I then received feedback from my roommate Raine, on this very low fidelity version and learned that there would be five tabs: <b> home/feed, a tab to see groups, taking a picture, profile, and settings. </b>
