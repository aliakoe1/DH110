# Assignment 1 

## About the Project: 
 Often, there are beautiful and exciting moments in an individualâ€™s day that they want to share with their family. However, with busy schedules or long distance relationships this task can prove to be a difficult task. For this project, I hope to create a project where families can share the little exciting moments in their day in a stream-like fashion for the rest of their group to enjoy. This mutual daily update can add context for real conversation when they see each other.

Evaluation: 
Locket is a widget app that displays photos of your friends or family to your home screen. It allows you to reply to the things that your friends show you. The app naturally refreshes when a new photo is sent across all different screens. 

Severity Rating Scale: 
1. Very vital fix- heavily affects user experience 
2. Less important - slightly impacts experience 
3. Not necessary - improves experience but not essential

Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status (this shows the user where they are in terms of their last steps and next steps)
     a. Evaluation: Bad: there is no indication of status when scrolling through the stream of photos, 
     b. Severity rating: 1- Users should be able to see where they are in the stream especially where there are hundreds of photos to navigate  through.
