# Assignment 1 

## About the Project: 
 Often, there are beautiful and exciting moments in an individual’s day that they want to share with their family. However, with busy schedules or long distance relationships this task can prove to be a difficult task. For this project, I hope to create a project where families can share the little exciting moments in their day in a stream-like fashion for the rest of their group to enjoy. This mutual daily update can add context for real conversation when they see each other. 

## Competitor App : Locket

Evaluation: 
Locket is a widget app that displays photos of your friends or family to your home screen. It allows you to reply to the things that your friends show you. The app naturally refreshes when a new photo is sent across all different screens. 

Severity Rating Scale: 
1. Very vital fix- heavily affects user experience 
2. Less important - slightly impacts experience 
3. Not necessary - improves experience but not essential

Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status (this shows the user where they are in terms of their last steps and next steps)
   
     a. Evaluation: Bad: there is no indication of status when scrolling through the stream of photos,

     b. Severity rating: 1- Users should be able to see where they are in the stream especially where there are hundreds of photos to navigate  through.
     


2. Match between system and the real world (This translates the user’s familiarity with the world to the app) 

     a. Good: the camera set up is familiar with a large button in the middle 
     
     b. 3- There could be more features added to make it more like a camera but as is, it is not hard for the user to understand. 
     
     
     
3. User control and freedom (this allows the user to freely navigate the page and undo or exit if needed)

     a. Good: all of the possible tabs the user can navigate are shown on the main screen, however, if you navigate to these tabs, there is only one button that forces you to go to the home screen before going out again
     
     b. 2- It would help if there were multiple ways to navigate to separate tabs instead of just having to go back through the home screen 
     
     

4. Consistency and standards (this enables consistency across other platforms and the digital sphere)

     a. Good: it maintains a large white button in the center of the screen to indicate to the user to take a photo 
     
     <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3090.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
     <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3087.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400">
     <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3088.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
     
     b. 3 - No need to change it, the only possible improvement is changing the position of the reverse camera function because it takes away from the main button
     
     
     
5. Error prevention (this forces the user to acknowledge if an action is intentional to prevent mistakes)

     a. Good - before deleting the account it asks specifically why you want to delete the account and the last step is to go back before confirming 
     
     b. 3- there are very minimal features on the app and so i wouldn't add any error prevention windows to other parts of the app and this one is good. 
     
     
     
6. Recognition rather than recall (this shows recognizable symbols so the user is able to navigate with ease)

      a. Bad - They use an interesting symbol to indicate friends but the bar itself does not make sense. They do use the chat symbol and profile symbol that are easy to recognize
     
      b. 2- they could change this icon to be an add friends symbol because that is what the function of the icon actually does 
      
      

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use(this creates potential shortcuts for experienced users to save time) 
     
      a. Good - they include a grid function that allows you to see the entire stream without having to scroll through one by one, It also lets you filter it by user so you can find the content you are looking for 
      
      b. 3- no changes I would make here
      
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design (this minimizes excess information on the screen) 
      a. Good - they use words when they cant sum it up in symbols and the icons are very effective 
       
      b. 3- There is an additional sparkle icon next to some of the words that are kind of unnecessary  
       
       
       
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (this is that the error message clearly tells the user what they need to do to fix it) 
        
      a. Bad- there is no indication of change of tab at the top of the screen, It doesn't show you how to get back to the original screen
        
      b. 2- It would help to indicate to the user where they are in the app so that they can navigate accordingly.
        
        
10. Help and documentation(this guides the user if they need extra information on a particular feature) 

      a. Bad - the get help screen sends you to draft an email instead of helping you navigate the system 
        
      b. 1- It would be helpful to have a better guide on how to navigate the app
