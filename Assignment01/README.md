## About My Project (Family Stream) : 
 Often, there are beautiful and exciting moments in an individual’s day that they want to share with their family. However, with busy schedules or long distance relationships this task can prove to be a difficult task. For this project, I hope to create a project where families can share the little exciting moments in their day in a stream-like fashion for the rest of their group to enjoy. This mutual daily update can add context for real conversation when they see each other. 

## Competitor App : Locket

Evaluation: 
Locket is a widget app that displays photos of your friends or family to your home screen. It allows you to reply to the things that your friends show you. The app naturally refreshes when a new photo is sent across all different screens. 

Severity Rating Scale: 
1. Very vital fix- heavily affects user experience 
2. Less important - slightly impacts experience 
3. Not necessary - improves experience but not essential

(bullet point a is the evaluation and b is the severity rating) 

Heuristics

1. Visibility of system status (this shows the user where they are in terms of their last steps and next steps)
   
     a. Evaluation: Bad: there is no indication of status when scrolling through the stream of photos, 
    
    <img src ="https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3085.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400" >
     
     b. Severity rating: 1- Users should be able to see where they are in the stream especially where there are hundreds of photos to navigate  through.
     


2. Match between system and the real world (This translates the user’s familiarity with the world to the app) 

     a. Good: the camera set up is familiar with a large button in the middle 
     
     b. 3- There could be more features added to make it more like a camera but as is, it is not hard for the user to understand. 
     
     
     
3. User control and freedom (this allows the user to freely navigate the page and undo or exit if needed)

     a. Good: all of the possible tabs the user can navigate are shown on the main screen, however, if you navigate to these tabs, there is only one button that forces you to go to the home screen before going out again
     
     b. 2- It would help if there were multiple ways to navigate to separate tabs instead of just having to go back through the home screen 
     
     

4. Consistency and standards (this enables consistency across other platforms and the digital sphere)

     a. Good: it maintains a large white button in the center of the screen to indicate to the user to take a photo 
     
     <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3090.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
     <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3087.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400">
     <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3088.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
     
     b. 3 - No need to change it, the only possible improvement is changing the position of the reverse camera function because it takes away from the main button
     
     
     
5. Error prevention (this forces the user to acknowledge if an action is intentional to prevent mistakes)

     a. Good - before deleting the account it asks specifically why you want to delete the account and the last step is to go back before confirming 
     
      <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/locket/IMG_3089.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
    
     
     b. 3- there are very minimal features on the app and so i wouldn't add any error prevention windows to other parts of the app and this one is good. 
     
     
     
6. Recognition rather than recall (this shows recognizable symbols so the user is able to navigate with ease)

      a. Bad - They use an interesting symbol to indicate friends but the bar itself does not make sense. They do use the chat symbol and profile symbol that are easy to recognize
     
      b. 2- they could change this icon to be an add friends symbol because that is what the function of the icon actually does 
      
      

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use(this creates potential shortcuts for experienced users to save time) 
     
      a. Good - they include a grid function that allows you to see the entire stream without having to scroll through one by one, It also lets you filter it by user so you can find the content you are looking for 
      
      b. 3- no changes I would make here
      
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design (this minimizes excess information on the screen) 
      a. Good - they use words when they cant sum it up in symbols and the icons are very effective 
       
      b. 3- There is an additional sparkle icon next to some of the words that are kind of unnecessary  
       
       
       
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (this is that the error message clearly tells the user what they need to do to fix it) 
        
      a. Bad- there is no indication of change of tab at the top of the screen, It doesn't show you how to get back to the original screen
        
      b. 2- It would help to indicate to the user where they are in the app so that they can navigate accordingly.
        
        
10. Help and documentation(this guides the user if they need extra information on a particular feature) 

      a. Bad - the get help screen sends you to draft an email instead of helping you navigate the system 
        
      b. 1- It would be helpful to have a better guide on how to navigate the app 



## Competitor App: Ekko 

<img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/ekko/IMG_3091.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
    
    
Link:  
https://www.ekko.pics/

Evaluation: 
Ekko is an app that creates a photo stream to the other person’s screens. The focus of the app is to have different streams for different occasions. They also include a fun feature that enables the user to “wrap their photo.


1. Visibility of system status (this shows the user where they are in terms of their last steps and next steps)
      
      a. Good: the system has very limited capabilities, you can only join a stream, create a stream, or add to a stream so it is fairly simple to navigate
      
      b. 3- The only thing I would change is creating a different symbol for adding to a stream versus joining a stream 
      

2. Match between system and the real world (This translates the user’s familiarity with the world to the app) 
     
      a. Bad: the middle plus sign should be equivalent to a camera themed button
     
     <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/ekko/IMG_3095.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
      
      
      b. 1- I would change the center to be a view of the camera with a camera button 
      
      
3. User control and freedom(this allows the user to freely navigate the page and undo or exit if needed)
     a. Good: There is only r pages to navigate between which is the home page, creating/joining a stream, or going to the settings 
     
     b. 3- The only possible fix is to create the navigation in a central location but not necessary 
     

4. Consistency and standards (this enables consistency across other platforms and the digital sphere)
    
     a. Bad: the plus sign typically indicates uploading or adding a file, not taking a picture. 
     
     b. 1 - Definitely needs to be changed to a camera symbol of sorts 
     
   
5. Error prevention (this forces the user to acknowledge if an action is intentional to prevent mistakes)

    a. Bad: I had a lot of trouble signing in because it uses the apple ID and provided very poor instructions on how to fix this issue 
  
  <img src = "https://github.com/aliakoe1/DH110-ALIAKOE/blob/main/ekko/IMG_3093.PNG?raw=true" width = "200" height = "400"> 
    
    
   b. 1- It definitely needs to indicate that the user must select a certain settings in the apple sign in to activate the app
    
    
6. Recognition rather than recall (this shows recognizable symbols so the user is able to navigate with ease)
    
    a. Good: They use a plus sign and a person sign, one indicates adding to something and the other indicates profile 
    
    b. 2- the profile tab serves more of a settings page so it could be changed to the typical settings icon. 
    
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use(this creates potential shortcuts for experienced users to save time) 

    a. Good: There isnt much of a need because of the limited features but it directs the user to add to the stream which is the main purpose for opening the app so it does a good job.
    
    b. 2- It is pretty clear. It could better indicate that the top bottom is creating/joining a stream but could use a different icon. 
    
   
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design (this minimizes excess information on the screen) 
   
   a. Good: The only things that exist on the screen are the three tabs and a short description during landing.
   
   b. 2- It could reduce the description under the camera function, this would especially be improved if they change the plug sign. 
   
   
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (this is that the error message clearly tells the user what they need to do to fix it) 

    a. Bad: the error message in the onboarding process contained incorrect information that was unhelpful in resolving the issue. 
    
    b. 1- This error message did not help recognize or recover from the error and would be in highest priority to change as this step inputs users into the app. 
    

10. Help and documentation(this guides the user if they need extra information on a particular feature) 

    a. Bad: There is very limited information in the app about how to navigate certain features. 
    
    b. 2- It would help to have more information and with a higher level of clarity than the other descriptions currently present.
