# Assignment 1 

## About the Project: 
 Often, there are beautiful and exciting moments in an individualâ€™s day that they want to share with their family. However, with busy schedules or long distance relationships this task can prove to be a difficult task. For this project, I hope to create a project where families can share the little exciting moments in their day in a stream-like fashion for the rest of their group to enjoy. This mutual daily update can add context for real conversation when they see each other.

Evaluation: 
Locket is a widget app that displays photos of your friends or family to your home screen. It allows you to reply to the things that your friends show you. The app naturally refreshes when a new photo is sent across all different screens.
