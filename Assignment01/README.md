### Assignment 1 

## About the Project: 
 Often, there are beautiful and exciting moments in an individualâ€™s day that they want to share with their family. However, with busy schedules or long distance relationships this task can prove to be a difficult task. For this project, I hope to create a project where families can share the little exciting moments in their day in a stream-like fashion for the rest of their group to enjoy. This mutual daily update can add context for real conversation when they see each other.
